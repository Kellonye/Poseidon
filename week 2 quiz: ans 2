Question 2:
Write a function that takes a sentence, capitalizes the words of the sentence (first letter of all the words), and returns the transformed sentence.
For example: function_name("a short sentence") should return "A Short Sentence"



Ans 2:

const mySentence = "iheme morgan is a political jobber and tout";
const words = mySentence.split(" ");
words.map((word) => {
return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.substring(1);
}).join(" ");

// this will print 'Iheme Morgan Is A Political Jobber And Tout' to the console.
