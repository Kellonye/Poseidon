Question 4:
Write a function that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of all that numberâ€™s digits.
For example: function_name(1234) should return 10 which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4. (Assume that the number you are given will always be positive.)


Ans 4:

first consideration:

I could write a simple addition function like this below;

function kSum(a,b,c) {
	return a + b + c
	}

console.log(kSum(a,b,c);

// such that kSum value of (15,12,13) will return 40 as its value.


second consideration:


or a more complex one like this below;


	var myNumList = [30, 18, 7, 13, 12]
     
    // need to create a variable to store the sum
    	var sum = 0;
     
    // Running the for loop
    	for (let i = 0; i < myNumList.length; i++) {
        sum += myNumList[i];
    }
     
    	console.log(sum);
      
    //such that myNumList will print, to the console, the value '80'
