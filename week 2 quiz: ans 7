Question 7:
Write a function that takes in a list and removes elements of the list that are the same.
For example: 'function_name([1, 1, 2, 2]) should return [1, 2].
Donâ€™t remove every occurrence, since you need to keep a single occurrence of a number. The order in which you present your output does not matter. So returning [1, 2, 3] is the same as returning [3, 1, 2].
Do not modify the list you take as input! Instead, return a new list.



ANSWER:

sameItem = (n) => {
 var rn = n.split('').map(Number);
 
 for (let i = 0; i < rn.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j = rn.length; j++) {
        if (rn[i] == rn[j]) {
            return rn[i];
    }
    
    }

 }

}
